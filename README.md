# Poseidon
Golang Apfell Agent

Find the latest version of Poseidon in the MythicAgents repository here: https://github.com/MythicAgents/poseidon

I owe a huge thanks to @djhohnstein for his help with this project.
## Build Instructions

Fill out the `profile.go` file with your C2 Listener information.

Then navigate to `Manage Operations > Payload Management` on the Apfell server, and import the `poseidon.json` file. This registers the payload with the Apfell server as an externally hosted payload.

You can then register the payload with the C2 server via `Create Components > Create Payload` on the Apfell server, and stuff the GUID and other relevant information into `profile.go`

Then build the agent _either_ on the target operating system you wish to run the agent against or compile using xgo (https://hub.docker.com/r/karalabe/xgo-latest/builds)

`go build -tags=default cmd/agent/main.go`
or
`go build -tags=restfulpatchthrough cmd/agent/main.go`

Once the agent is built, all that's left is to execute.

## Killable Jobs

Due to the way Go-routines function, it's difficult if not impossible to kill them. As a result, only certain long-running tasks are able to receive a "kill" signal. The current list of killable jobs are:
- `triagedirectory`
- `portscan`
